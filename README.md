# Restaurant-Sales-and-Revenue-Analysis
This project uses a sample dataset from Kaggle, performs comprehensive data cleaning with Pandas, enriches the dataset by adding new analytical columns, and visualizes key insights using Matplotlib for effective exploratory data analysis.

reset_index() - To convert the index of a Series into a column to form a DataFrame.
info() - To provide the basic information about the dataframe.
drop() - To drop any column or row from the dataframe.
duplicated() - To show all the duplicate records from a dataframe.
drop_duplicates(inplace=True) - To remove the duplicate records from the dataframe.
round() - To round-off the values of a numerical column.
pd.to_datetime() - To convert the datatype of date column into datetime format.
groupby() - To make the group of all unique values of a column.
std()  - To check the standard deviation of any numerical column.
var()  - To check the variance of any numerical column.
mean()  - To check the mean of any numerical column.
agg() - Using agg() with groupby().
head() - It shows the first N rows in the data (by default, N=5).
columns - To show all the column names of the dataframe.
unique() - In a column, it shows all the unique values. It can be applied on a single column only, not on the whole dataframe.
nunique() - It shows the total no. of unique values in each column. It can be applied on a single column as well as on the whole dataframe.
describe() - To show some summary about the columns.

value_counts - In a column, it shows all the unique values with their count. It can be applied on a single column only.
plot(kind='bar') - To draw the bar graph.
type() - To the type of any variable.
plt.figure(figsize = ()) - To set the size of any figure.
plt.title(), plt.xlabel(), plt.ylabel() - To set the Title, x-axis label, y-axis label.
sort_values(ascending = False) - To sort the values in descending order.
